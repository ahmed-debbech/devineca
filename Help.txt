How to Play:
The game principle is simple
The Computer will choose a number of 3 random digits,
your role is to find it.
You must first enter a number of 3 digits ONLY.
(N.B: you can repeat a number two or three times)
After comparing your number and the number of the Computer,
the computer will display letters:
-If it displays the letter "V" it means that THE NUMBER IS CORRECT AND IN ITS PALACE.
-If it displays the letter "C" it means that THE NUMBER IS CORRECT BUT IT IS NOT IN ITS PLACE.
The numbers with the letters are the repetition indicators. For example:
C2 + V1: "C2" indicates that there are two numbers do not have the correct place and you have to change places
and "V1" indicates that there is a correct number and in its place and it is not touched.
In case the computer displays "C0 + V0" it means there is no correct number
Thanks to your previous results you have to guess the correct number
If the computer displays "V3 + C0" YOU WIN and Found the correct number!
Enjoy!
